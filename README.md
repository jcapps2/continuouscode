# Continuous Code
This project is based off of https://hackr.io/. A site where users can share online learning resources pertaining to a topic.

## Why
I wanted a project to learn more about Next.js and, more specifically, its server-side rendering capabilities. Also hosted this on an EC2 instance in AWS in order to get some experience in that space.

## Features
### Browse Education Resources
Anyone can go to the site and browse online education resources by topic.
### Account Creation
Users can create an account and contribute with their own educational resources.
### Admin Account
The admin has increased privileges as opposes to the regular user. The admin can create new topics, as well as delete individual posts and topics. The admin also possesses all of the same abilities as a normal user, and can upload educational resources.
